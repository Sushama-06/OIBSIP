            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Soldiers! I don’t have words to thank you. It’s their selfless love towards our nation that makes them
                to offer the supreme sacrifice for us! It’s their bravery, courage, best skills, perfection and
                Excellency that makes them special and eligible to serve our motherland.
                World’s 4th largest and powerful military that is our Indian Defence Forces works in one of the world’s
                toughest battle fields. They serve our country in extreme conditions. They are our real heroes.
                Presently it is one of the top militaries of the world and also having a glorious and decent history
                too! <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Soldiers are our pride. They not only secures our borders but gives selfless service by serving our
                nation in internal problems also, keep our country’s flag high in sports also. They also give their
                service at international level by serving the mankind worldwide. Their contribution is countless That’s
                what makes a perfect soldier.
                These forces are meant to assist the Armed Forces of India. These forces constitute the soldiers of
                Indian army and navy. And so on…..
                They sacrifice everything for us and our country. They leave their family, friends, home and all the
                comfort for securing our comfort. We Indians mostly forget their supreme sacrifice and never try to
                understand their emotions and feelings. It’s our biggest fault. We should be thankful for everything
                they do for us. We are not at all that great, we cannot afford to pay the debt of their service and
                sacrifice! 
                <p class="p1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our great soldiers are the back bone of our country. It’s our moral duty to respect and love them.
                 we are lucky and blessed that we have Indian Army!
